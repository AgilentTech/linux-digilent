Digilent ZYBO AXI-I2S SSM2603 CPU DAI bindings

Note: The card is initially designed for ZYBO linux_bd design which use I2S
      and external SSM2603 codec. The SSM2603 is driven by a fixed clock of
      12.288MHz which does not have 44.1KHz sampling rate support.

Required properties:
	- compatible	: Must be "digilent,zybo-sound"
	- audio-code	: A phandle reference to a audio codec
	- cpu-dai	: A phandle reference to a CPU DAI controller

Example:

	zybo_ssm2603_snd: zybo_ssm2603_snd {
		compatible = "digilent,zybo-sound";
		audio-codec = <&ssm2603>;
		cpu-dai = <&axi_i2s_adi_0>;
	};
